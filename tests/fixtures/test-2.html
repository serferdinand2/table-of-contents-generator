											Inclusive surveys help promote

										</p>
										<p>
											When inclusivity is practiced, the
											diversity of individuals is
											acknowledged and respected and we
											work towards a world free of
											prejudice and discrimination.
										</p>
										<p>
											<em
												>If you care about diversity,
												inclusivity, and societal

											a more welcoming and accepting

											Why is it important to carry out an
											inclusive survey?
										</h2>
										<p>
											Writing inclusive surveys is
											essential for several reasons:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>
													Ensure accurate data:
													Inclusive surveys help
													provide an opportunity for
													everyone to be included in
													the sample. When a survey is
													not inclusive, it can miss
													essential perspectives or
													experiences that will affect
													the validity of the data.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Increases participation:
													Finding survey respondents
													is hard enough. Inclusive
													surveys can increase return
													rates by making more
													participants feel welcome
													and valued, which increases
													the pool of respondents.
												</p>
												<p>
													To better understand this
													dynamic, see our blog “<a
														href="https://blog.surveyplanet.com/average-survey-response-rate-what-is-a-good-survey-response-rate"
														>What is a good survey
														response rate</a
													>?”
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Avoids biases: Avoid biases
													that may occur if certain
													groups are excluded or not
													considered with inclusive
													surveys. A survey that is
													not inclusive may
													unintentionally favor
													certain groups or exclude
													others. Read our blog about
													<a
														href="https://blog.surveyplanet.com/inaccurate-surveys-how-to-avoid-biased-questions"
														>biased surveys</a
													>
													and their inherent
													disadvantages to better
													understand how to avoid
													common mistakes like biased
													survey questions.

											id="why-is-gender-a-question-essential-for-an-inclusive-survey">
											Why is gender a question essential
											for an inclusive survey?
										</h2>
										<p>
											Gender survey options and
											inclusivity are interconnected.
											Gender is a fundamental aspect of
											identity; acknowledging the
											variousness of gender identities in
											a survey is essential. Inclusive
											gender survey options recognize and
											appreciate that gender is not binary
											and that there is a range of gender
											identities beyond male and female.
										</p>
										<p>
											For example, providing inclusive
											gender options in
											surveys—“transgender,” “non-binary,”
											“genderqueer,” and “gender
											non-conforming” in addition to
											“male” and “female”—reflects the
											diversity of gender identities and
											allows individuals to express their
											gender identity in a way that feels
											true to them.
										</p>
										<p>
											Including inclusive gender survey
											options also acknowledges that some
											individuals may not identify with
											the gender they were assigned at
											birth and that their gender identity
											may not be immediately apparent.
											Providing inclusive gender options
											creates a safe space for all
											individuals to participate without
											feeling excluded or invalidated.
										</p>
										<p>
											Additionally, providing inclusive
											gender survey options promotes
											awareness and education about gender
											diversity. This helps to break down
											harmful stereotypes and promotes
											greater inclusivity and acceptance
											of all individuals.
										</p>
										<h2
											id="seven-tips-for-writing-an-inclusive-survey">
											Seven tips for writing an inclusive
											survey
										</h2>
										<p>
											Writing an inclusive survey requires
											considering language carefully.
											Format and content can be used to
											ensure that all individuals can
											participate comfortably, accurately
											representing their experiences and
											opinions. Here are some tips about
											how to write an inclusive survey:
										</p>
										<h3 id="1-use-inclusive-language">
											1. Use inclusive language
										</h3>
										<p>
											Use transparent and inclusive
											language that is easy to understand.
											Avoid using jargon, abbreviations,
											or technical terms that may be
											unfamiliar to some participants. Use
											gender-neutral language and avoid
											assumptions about a participant’s
											gender, sexual orientation, race,
											ethnicity, or cultural background.
										</p>
										<p>
											Use language that includes all
											individuals regardless of gender,
											race, ethnicity, religion, age,
											disability, or sexual orientation.
											For example, instead of asking,
											“What is your gender?” use a
											question such as “What gender do you
											identify with?” or “How do you
											describe your gender?”
										</p>
										<p>
											Interested in finding out more about
											demographic questions? Please read
											our blog on
											<a
												href="https://blog.surveyplanet.com/how-to-use-demographic-survey-questions-examples-and-phrasing-guidelines"
												>how to use demographic survey
												questions</a
											>
											to learn about phrasing guidelines.
										</p>
										<h3
											id="2-provide-a-spectrum-of-inclusive-options">
											2. Provide a spectrum of inclusive
											options
										</h3>
										<p>
											It is imperative to provide a range
											of options for participants,
											including “prefer not to say” for
											sensitive questions. The
											possibilities should be inclusive
											and reflect the diversity of
											participants.
										</p>
										<p>
											Offer various response options that
											allow participants to represent
											their experiences accurately. For
											example, instead of only offering
											“male” or “female,” consider
											offering gender identity survey
											options such as “non-binary,”
											“genderqueer,” or “prefer not to
											say.”
										</p>
										<h4
											id="inclusive-gender-options-for-surveys">
											Inclusive gender options for surveys
										</h4>
										<p>
											Regarding inclusive gender options
											for surveys, it’s essential to
											acknowledge and respect that gender
											is not binary, and that there are
											gender identities beyond male and
											female. Here are some examples of
											gender identity survey options that
											can be used:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Male</li>
											<li>Female</li>
											<li>Transgender Male/Trans Man</li>
											<li>
												Transgender Female/Trans Woman
											</li>
											<li>Non-binary</li>
											<li>Genderqueer</li>
											<li>Gender non-conforming</li>
											<li>Two-spirit</li>
											<li>
												Other (with an open text field
												for participants to specify)
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											It’s important to note that some
											individuals may prefer to use
											different terms or labels to
											describe their gender identity;
											therefore, providing an “other”
											option with an open text field in
											which participants can specify how
											they identify is good. Additionally,
											it’s important to provide a “prefer
											not to say” option for those who do
											not wish to disclose their gender
											identity.
										</p>
										<p>
											Overall, the goal is to create a
											safe and inclusive space for all
											participants to express their gender
											identity. In addition, by providing
											a range of options, we can create
											more inclusive surveys that respect
											and acknowledge the diversity of
											gender identities.
										</p>
										<h3 id="3-avoid-assumptions">
											3. Avoid assumptions
										</h3>
										<p>
											Clarity is the key component of
											every
											<a
												href="https://blog.surveyplanet.com/what-is-a-good-survey-question-well-written-examples"
												>good survey question</a
											>. Therefore, ensure that questions
											are clear and concise and avoid
											using leading or loaded questions
											that may spoil responses. Use a mix
											of open-ended and closed-ended
											questions while providing an “other”
											or “not applicable” option where
											appropriate.
										</p>
										<p>
											Avoid making assumptions about your
											participants’ experiences or
											preferences. For example, instead of
											assuming everyone celebrates the
											same holidays, ask a question such
											as “What holidays do you celebrate?”
										</p>
										<h3
											id="4-consider-cultural-differences">
											4. Consider cultural differences
										</h3>
										<p>
											Cultural differences are a set of
											practices—including languages,
											beliefs, behaviors, and
											expressions—that are considered
											unique to members of a specific
											group of shared ethnicity, race, or
											national origin.
										</p>
										<p>
											Be sensitive to cultural differences
											and avoid using what will be
											unfamiliar, offensive language or
											concepts for some participants.
											Instead, consider providing
											explanations or definitions for
											terms that are not universally
											understood.
										</p>
										<h3 id="5-consider-accessibility">
											5. Consider accessibility
										</h3>
										<p>
											Ensure the survey is accessible to
											all participants, including those
											with disabilities. Use accessible
											formats such as large fonts,
											contrasting colors, and alternative
											text descriptions for images.
											Provide closed captioning or
											transcripts for videos and audio
											content.
										</p>
										<p>
											Additionally, consider the option of
											completing the survey in a language
											other than English.
										</p>
										<p>
											Organize surveys in a logical and
											easy-to-follow structure. Use clear
											headings, subheadings, and bullet
											points to break up long blocks of
											text. Questions should be ordered
											logically, with the survey flowing
											smoothly. Our
											<a
												href="https://blog.surveyplanet.com/what-do-i-do-with-my-survey-responses-2"
												>11 tips for creating an
												engaging online survey</a
											>
											can help maintain survey flow.
										</p>
										<h3 id="6-test-the-survey-first">
											6. Test the survey first
										</h3>
										<p>
											Test the survey with diverse
											participants to ensure it is
											inclusive and accessible. Use the
											feedback from the test group to make
											any necessary changes to improve
											clarity, understandability, and
											inclusivity.
										</p>
										<p>
											To understand such feedback
											accurately, the basics of survey
											data collection need to be
											understood. Read our
											<a
												href="https://blog.surveyplanet.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-survey-data-collection-methods-examples-analysis"
												>ultimate guide to survey data
												collection</a
											>
											to help better incorporate feedback
											into a survey.
										</p>
										<h3
											id="7-dont-forget-about-confidentiality">
											7. Don’t forget about
											confidentiality
										</h3>
										<p>
											Last but not least, ensure that the
											survey is confidential and that
											participants understand their
											responses will be kept anonymous.
											This encourages respondents to
											answer honestly and openly.
										</p>
										<p>
											Conducting an anonymous survey is a
											research best practice. See our
											guide explaining
